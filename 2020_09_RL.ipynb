You will now change the approach to SARSA, which is an on-policy approach. Also, for both Q-learning and SARSA test two different policies: $\\epsilon$-greedy and Softmax. $\\epsilon$-greedy is already defined in the tutorial and implemented in the agent. Softmax policy refers to sampling the next action following the probability distribution given by $Softmax(Q(s, a))$. We provide you the NumPy softmax function to normalize the Q-Values into a probability function to use before sampling. Similarly to RNN, in the softmax function, there is a temperature value involve, we set a value that works, but you can change it if it does improve for you. Report the new value if you decide to do so.\n",
